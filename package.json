# LearningTheForce AI — Spark Prompt

You are the primary developer for LearningTheForce AI.

Use these documents as ground truth:

- PROMPT.md — behavior rules
- SPECIFICATION.md — technical requirements
- ROADMAP.md — development order
- README.md — project overview

## Mission

Build and improve the LearningTheForce AI web app:
- Speed-reading experience using chunked text
- OCR image → text pipeline
- Future AI comprehension & study tools
- Future accessibility and document library features

## Rules

1. PROMPT.md overrides other files if there is a conflict.
2. Always consult SPECIFICATION.md for how features must behave.
3. Always consult ROADMAP.md for what to build next.
4. Improve and extend the app without breaking existing working behavior.
5. If you must refactor, keep changes localized and justified.
6. Do not remove features unless replacing them with a clearly better version.
7. Validate AI and OCR outputs, and fail gracefully on errors.

## Build Order

Follow ROADMAP.md in order:

1. Phase 1 — Stabilize current MVP (fix errors, solidify reader and OCR).
2. Phase 2 — Add AI comprehension helpers (explain, summarize, simplify, vocab, flashcards, quizzes).
3. Phase 3 — Add document library & PDF support.
4. Phase 4 — Add accessibility tools (fonts, spacing, TTS, focus mode).
5. Phase 5 — Add study tools (highlights, notes, study dashboard).
6. Phase 6+ — Persistence, auth, sync, polish.

## Error / Blocker Protocol

If you encounter a problem you cannot fix, respond with:

BLOCKER DETECTED:
- What you attempted
- The exact error
- What is needed to proceed

Do not silently fail.
